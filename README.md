# C++ Exercises Collection ðŸ’»

This repository consists of a collection of basic C++ exercises that cover a range of topics including:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics**
- **Graph Algorithms**

## ðŸ“¥ Installation

To get started with these exercises, youâ€™ll need to have C++ and a compatible IDE or text editor installed.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GabiUdroiu/Facultate.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Facultate
    ```

3. Compile and run individual C++ files using a C++ compiler (like `g++` or an IDE like Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or Xcode):
    ```bash
    g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello_world
    ./hello_world
    ```

Each exercise is self-contained, and you can compile and run them individually.

## ðŸš€ Usage

You can go through each C++ exercise and run them on your own machine. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

1. **Exercise 1: Hello World**
    - Open `hello_world.cpp`.
    - Compile and run the program using your preferred C++ compiler.

    ```bash
    g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello_world
    ./hello_world
    ```

2. **Exercise 2: Simple Calculator**
    - Open `simple_calculator.cpp`.
    - Compile and run the program as shown above.

Continue exploring and completing the exercises to practice!
